BlazeLoader
===========

BlazeLoader is a minecraft mod API built on the LiteAPI framework.  It is very lightweight, requiring no base class edits at all!  By using LiteAPI, all BlazeLoader mods are automatically LiteLoader mods as well!   All mod loading is done by LiteLoader's stable loader.  Suggestions and code contributions are welcome!
